# Charm of Undying

Charm of Undying is a mod that uses Curios API/Trinkets API to add a new slot, the Charm slot, to the player inventory
and allows the Totem of Undying to be placed into this slot.
## Features

### Fabric

While the totem is in this slot, the player will be granted the same death protection effect as if it was held in the
player's hand. This allows the player to gain the benefits of the totem without the hassle of needing to remember to
hold the totem or the need to sacrifice a useful hotbar/inventory slot to keep one around.
